## FPTA
<ul>
<li>FPTA is a toolkit for analyzing functional form games (FFG), a skew symmetric function $f(x,y) = -f(y,x)$, where $f$ is a two player symmetric, zero-sum game. The vector $x$ and $y$ represents the traits of the players, and $f$ outputs the advantage of player with traits $x$ over player with trait vector $y$. The toolkit decomposes the game into a sequence of simple and visualizable "disc games".

<li> For installation, please type devtools::install_github("patrickbai97/FPTA") in R.

<li> Tutorials with a toy example can be found in the vignettes folder of the package
