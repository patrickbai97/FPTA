Description: This package aims to present an analysis of a symmetric, two-player, zero-sum game where payout is a function of agent traits, and those traits are drawn from an underlying distribution. User should provide players traits, outcome of the payout function and a sequence of basis functions. The package will return a functional form estimate of the payout function using FPTA.
