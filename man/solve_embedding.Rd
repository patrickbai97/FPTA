\title{This functions is the function which calculates the functional form of the disc game embedding via 3 steps, 1. Gram-Schmidt 2. Calculate projection matrix 3. calculate a sequence of disc game embedding}
\usage{
solve_embedding(f_val = NULL, list_basis = NULL, Xsample = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{f_val}{n x n skew symmetric matrix, with i,j th entry representing f(x_i, x_j)}

\item{list_basis}{a list of k vectorized function provided by the user}

\item{Xsample}{n samples, possible n x p matrix associated with f_val}
}
\value{
a list containing a vector lambda, which calculates the relative importance of the embedding, an 2p x k coefficient matrix, Mat_Embed_Coef
where 2i-1 and 2i row is the coefficients of the basis function associated with the ith embedding. The 2i-1 row is the embedding for the x-coordinate, the 2i th row is the embedding for the y-coordinate.
